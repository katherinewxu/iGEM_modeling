# iGEM_modeling

Dry Lab efforts for modeling including:
- Ordinary differential equations model for cell state prediction with Poisson-Beta model
- scRNA and methyl-seq analysis for gene co-regulation (TensorFlow)
- Transcription factor binding model that provides ideal Dux4-DBD concentration to outcompete Dux4-FL.
- Markov Chain predictive model for cell state prediction
- Ricci data analysis for disease severity assessment
